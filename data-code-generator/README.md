Generate code for reading/writing packets from [Burger](https://github.com/pokechu22/Burger). The only dependency is `requests`.

The directory name doesn't start with `azalea-` because it's not a Rust crate.

## Usage

`python main.py [packet id] [clientbound or serverbound] \[game/handshake/login/status\]`

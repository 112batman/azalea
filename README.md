# Azalea

A Minecraft botting library in Rust.
I named this Azalea because it sounds like a cool word and this is a cool library.
This project was heavily inspired by PrismarineJS.

## Goals

- Bypass all anticheats
- Only support the latest Minecraft version
- Do everything a vanilla client can do

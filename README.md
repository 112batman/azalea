# Azalea

A Rust library for creating Minecraft bots.

I named this Azalea because it sounds like a cool word and this is a cool library. This project was heavily inspired by PrismarineJS.

## Goals

- Do everything a vanilla client can do
- Be easy to use
- Bypass most/all anticheats
- Support the latest Minecraft version
- Be fast
